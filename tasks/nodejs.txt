Generate the package.json, index.html and other necessary files for a node.js project.
For each file include in the opening triple backticks the name of the file, for instance: ```index.js.
Any comments should be in a README.md file.
Once these files are saved, I should be able to run npm install and npm start and the project should run.
Note that if you include a markdown ``` section, you need to indent them 
    ```
so that it doesn't close the README.md file..
------------------------------
Example:
```index.js
...
```package.json
...
...
```README.md
Here's some code in a markdown section:
1. Install the dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2 Her's some javascript code:
   ```
   console.log('hello world');
   ```
...
